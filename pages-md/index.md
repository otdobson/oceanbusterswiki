## Welcome!

This is a demo of the [Bear Blog Replacement Template](https://github.com/y-arjun-y/bear-blog-replacement-template). It's a [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) blog in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) that allows you to write blog posts and create pages using the awesomeness that is Markdown.

This template comes _most_ of the features that [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev) comes with as well as:

- [LaTeX support with KaTeX](/blog/markdown-latex-demo).
- Greater customizability with meta tags/SEO.
- Ability to embed JavaScript and other multimedia.

Remember, **this is a template**. It's _your code_, _your words_ and _your data_. Period.

### How to get started

1. Clone [this repository](https://github.com/y-arjun-y/bear-blog-replacement-template) with:

```
git clone https://github.com/y-arjun-y/bear-blog-replacement-template
```

2. Write your blog posts in `blog-posts` and set-up your home page by editing the `index.md` file. The available front matter options are `title`, `publish_date`, `meta_description` and `meta_image`.

3. Optionally, you can create pages (that soon will automatically show up in the navigation bar) by adding Markdown files in `pages-md`.

4. Style your website with [a classless CSS](https://css-tricks.com/no-class-css-frameworks/) link in `_document.js` under `rel="stylesheet"`.
